    "The goal of this notebook is to gain intuition for Expectation Maximization using a simple example involving coin tosses.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section XIV, we introduce Expectation-Maximization (EM) as a practical way to perform maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) even when some of the data is hidden (i.e in the presence of latent or hidden variables). To better understand EM, in this short notebook we'll explore a very simple coin-tossing example adapted from [Do and Batzoglou, Nat. Biotechnol. (2008)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1406). \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we are given two coins A and B with unkown bias $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$, respectively. Our goal is to estimate the bias vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}= (\\theta_A, \\theta_B)$ from the outcomes of the following experiment: \n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote> \n",
    "First choose one coin at random. Then toss the selected coin 10 times independently and record the number of heads observed. Repeat this procedure 5 times.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, let $z_i\\in\\{A,B\\}$ be the coin selected in experiment $i$ and $x_i\\in\\{0,1,\\cdots 10\\}$ be the number heads recorded by tossing $z_i$ 10 times. Since we conduct $n=5$ such experiments, we can summarize the outcomes of these 50 tosses by two vectors: $\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,x_2\\cdots, x_5)$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}=(z_1,z_2,\\cdots, z_5)$.\n",

    "\n",
    " * Consider first the case where we have complete knowledge of the experiment, namely, both $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}$ are known. How would you intuitively estimate the biases of the two coins  $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}= (\\theta_A, \\theta_B)$ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We would flip the coins N times and record the number of heads, Nhead. The bias would then be NHead/N\n",
    " * What's the likelihood of observing the complete outcomes of these experiments? In other words, what is $P(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{z}| n,\\boldsymbol{\\theta} )$? You may assume this is a Bernoulli trial. Namely, every time coin A(B) is tossed, we have, with probability $\\theta_A$($\\theta_B$), that the outcome is heads.\n",

The following code computes our best guess for the biases using MLE -- assuming we know the identity of the coin used -- and compares it estimates arrived at using an EM procedure where we have no knowledge about which coin was being tossed (though we know the same coin was tossed 10 times)."
